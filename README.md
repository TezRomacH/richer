# Project: luxeprint - Styled Printing and Tables in Rust for Python 🚀

👋 Welcome to `luxeprint`, a Rust 🦀 library for advanced styled printing, tables, and emoji rendering 😀. 

This project was created entirely by the 🤖 **ChatGPT o1-preview model** and is being maintained by someone with little to no experience in Rust 🦀. Please bear with me as we figure this out together! 🙏

## Install

```bash
pip intall -U luxeprint
```

## Examples of Use

Here are some examples of how to use luxeprint in your projects.

✨ Styled Printing

You can use the library to print styled text directly from your Python code:

```python
from luxeprint.luxeprint import rprint

# Print styled text 🖨️
rprint("Hello, [bold magenta]World[/bold magenta]! :vampire:")
```

Supported colors:

```
"black"
"red"
"green"
"yellow"
"blue"
"magenta" | "purple"
"cyan"
"white"
"bright_black" | "grey" | "gray"
"bright_red"
"bright_green"
"bright_yellow"
"bright_blue"
"bright_magenta" | "bright_purple"
"bright_cyan"
"bright_white"
```

Supported styles:

```
"bold" | "b"
"dim" | "dimmed"
"italic" | "i"
"underline" | "u"
"blink"
"reverse"
"hidden"
"strikethrough"
```

📝 Render and Print Tables

Luxeprint also allows you to render and print tables, complete with ANSI styles:

```python
from luxeprint.luxeprint import render_table, rprint

# Data for the table 📊
data = [
    ["[blue]Name", "[red]Age", "[green]City"],
    ["Alice", "30", "New York"],
    ["Bob", "25", "Los Angeles"],
    ["Charlie", "35", "Chicago"]
]

# Render and print the table 🖨️
table_output = render_table(data)
rprint(table_output)
```

🎨 Highlight Code

Syntax highlighting is also available:

```python
from luxeprint.luxeprint import highlight

code = '''
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("World")
'''

highlighted_code = highlight(code, "python")
rprint(highlighted_code)
```

🤝 How to Contribute
